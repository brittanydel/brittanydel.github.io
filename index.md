During my time at SNHU, I have completed a variety of computer science courses to obtain my degree. Each of these courses were project-based in nature and allowed me to practice programming for professional and real-world situations. While I have already spent many years working professionally in web development, I was originally only a self-taught programmer. My computer science studies at SNHU have helped me learn industry standards, expectations and best practices.

The most important proficiency I learned is the software development life cycle (SDLC), which encompasses project planning, software design, quality assurance and testing, and product deployment. A successful SDLC requires skills in project management, team collaboration, and knowledge of Scrum methodology, which I have gained experience with through my courses. 

I have also learned in-depth about data structures and algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security. The following artifact, my [Graduation Playlist application](https://github.com/brittanydel/brittanydel.github.io), is a refined version of a java project created in my Collaboration and Team Management (CS-310) class which demonstrates the skills I have learned in these topics.

### About the Artifact

This artifact is a refined version of a java playlist application that was created in my Collaboration and Team Management (CS-310) class. This program is being altered to allow the user to open the playlist in YouTube via their web browser, whereas before, the program only printed the song list. This program will be accessible via GitHub with a detailed README documentation of the software development lifecycle for the application, screenshots of the working application, screenshots of the successful unit testing, and a tutorial of how the application may be modified or expanded upon for other users. 

This artifact was selected for my ePortfolio as it allows me to me to showcase my skills in developing a functioning, well-documented, well-written program that was tested and reviewed. The program is meant to be easily manageable by others, with provided documentation walking users through the creation process and how to use it for their own personal playlists. 

### Software Design and Engineering
**Enhancement Update and Process.** Since it’s possible that users may not have Spotify installed on their machine, the program was adjusted to automatically open the playlist in YouTube. The process of modifying the application was easily manageable, with the main tasks being cleaning out excess code and unused packages. The external link out was added successfully, which allowed me to learn more about the URI java class. 

## Algorithms and Data Structures
**Enhancement Update and Process.** For algorithms and data structures, the playlist application was updated in the prior milestone to automatically open the playlist in YouTube. An excel export of songs for the user to meet the database requirement. The process of adding the external link out to YouTube in the prior milestone was fairly easy, however I had more difficulty with implementing an excel export of data.

## Databases
**Enhancement Update and Process.** For databases, the playlist application was updated to export the playlist songlist into an Excel file saved on the user’s desktop. The Excel exporter was tested and updated in the program’s documentation. Apache POI jars had to be installed and called on for the Excel exporter to run successfully, which was a difficult setup in Eclipse IDE. The actual coding of the exporter was very simple, but I ran into many difficulties with path directories crashing after adding new dependencies in my pom.xml file. After fixing these issues, the exporter runs successfully.

## Security
Since this program runs locally on the user's computer, it is a secure program. There are no external scripts that could compromise the security or stability of the program for the user unless added directly by said user.
